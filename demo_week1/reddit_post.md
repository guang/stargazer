interesting persona/aggregated game stats you wanna see?



building a tool that computes personal/aggregated game stats via parsed .SC2Replay files (crawling tournament replay packs for sample data), kind of like running sc2gears/scelight on a mass scale to get insights. What interesting general stats/metrics would you like to see?

currently I have stuff like:
- (aggregated) win ratio for different starting position for a given race on a given map
- (personal) apm/win ratio by user based on race/map sliced by game, ie what is the apm for INnoVation in his past 20 games playing against zergs.

thank you for reading and lmk what interesting stats you wanna see :D (will update on progress)
